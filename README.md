# Dog-Breed-Identification
There are millions of types of dogs in the world, but when there is a dog standing in front of you, can you tell the breed of it? In this project, we are going to identify the breeds of dogs with only dog images. The basic goal is to have an image classifier which can classify dog breed images. We are going to train a model which can determine the breed of a dog in an image. The training dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs, but there are a limited number of training images per dog breed. Images for each label are between 65 to 125. The datasets we have include training images, testing images and labels for each images.
